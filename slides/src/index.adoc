== Wikipedia

Aspect-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that aims to *increase modularity* by alowing the separation of *cross-cutting concerns*.

It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code *without modifying the code* itself.

== Cross-cutting Examples

* Caching
* Logging
* Monitoring
* Transaction processing

Cross-cutting concerns are parts of a program that rely on or must affect many other parts of the system
