== When ?
* Compile-Time Weaving
* Post-Compile Weaving
* Load-Time Weaving 

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Compile-Time : easier when you have source code

Post-Compile: weaving on existing binaries

Load-Time: binary weaving defered until the point that a class loader loads a class file and defines the class to the JVM.
